ambiguity that lends its conflicts a symbolic resonance .', \"although very much like the first movie based on j.k. rowling 's phenomenal fantasy best sellers , this second go-round possesses a quite pleasing , headlong thrust and a likably delinquent attitude .\", 'a teasing drama whose relentless good-deed\\\\/bad-deed reversals are just interesting enough to make a sinner like me pray for an even more interesting , less symmetrical , less obviously cross-shaped creation .', 'flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with .', 'that rara avis : the intelligent romantic comedy with actual ideas on its mind .', 'an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen ,

marvellous journey from childhood idealism to adolescent self-absorption .', \"it 's a terrific american sports movie and dennis quaid is its athletic heart .\", 'rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .', 'smart science fiction for grown-ups , with only a few false steps along the way .', \"after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .\", 'it further declares its director , zhang yang of shower , as a boldly experimental , contemporary stylist with a bright future .', \"most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .\", 'on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt .', 'lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest

under pressure .', 'this is a film well worth seeing , talking and singing heads and all .', \"4 friends , 2 couples , 2000 miles , and all the pabst blue ribbon beer they can drink - it 's the ultimate redneck road-trip .\", \"if you can get past the fantastical aspects and harsh realities of `` the isle '' you 'll get a sock-you-in-the-eye flick that is a visual tour-de-force and a story that is unlike any you will likely see anywhere else .\", 'the film is exhilarating to watch because sandler , liberated from the constraints of formula , reveals unexpected depths as an actor .', \"a

astonishing .\", \"but it 's emotionally engrossing , too , thanks to strong , credible performances from the whole cast .\", \"more honest about alzheimer 's disease , i think , than iris .\", 'its scenes and sensibility are all more than familiar , but it exudes a kind of nostalgic spy-movie charm and , at the same time , is so fresh and free of the usual thriller nonsense that it all seems to
